This is the opposite of many computational approaches that begin with a mass of data, followed by an often failed attempt to simplify it.</p> <p>Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/1/000091/000091.html</p> <p>These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity.</p> <p>https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/two/working-with-data/experiencing-data/the-web-as-a-medium-for-data-visualisation</p>"}, {"location": "Design/Data-Viz/Data%20Visualisation/#podcasts-video-series", "title": "Podcasts &amp;
