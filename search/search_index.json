Folder items can be expanded to reveal the contents of the folder \u2014 which may be files, folders, or both \u2014 and collapsed, hiding its contents. Deque University - Tree View example Tree view is a hierarchical structure with parent and child nodes that can expand and collapse. Tree views on the web are not common, but they do exist, often to represent a file system or other similar structure of folders and files. ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) - Tree View ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) - File Directory Treeview Example Note Each of the above has a CodePen example ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) - Navigation Treeview example Often treeviews are used for complex nested navigation but this is not recommended Danger The above use of a treeview is an anti-pattern. Not the best accessibilty pattern to use. \u201cA pattern more suited for typical site navigation with expandable groups of links is the disclosure pattern. \u201c PatternFly Design System (from Red Hat) - Design Guidelines for tree view Other Links \u00b6 http://accessibleculture.org/articles/2013/02/not-so-simple-aria-tree-views-and-screen-readers/ (2013) https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/plugins/tree-view/","title":"UX Research   Tree view design pattern"},{"location":"Research/UX/UX%20Research%20-%20Tree%20view%20design%20pattern/#other-links","text":"http://accessibleculture.org/articles/2013/02/not-so-simple-aria-tree-views-and-screen-readers/ (2013) https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/plugins/tree-view/","title":"Other Links"}]}
