Scrolling or tabbing through a list of hundreds of items is time consuming and challenging. Within TDR we have at least two use cases for this scenario - selecting multiple FOI exemption codes and selecting multiple languages. Currently we have a separate page of checkboxes for choosing FOI exemption codes, which requires the user to leave the current page/form to select options before returning to complete the rest of the form. It would be more efficient, potentially less error prone if we could keep the user on the same form whilst they select multiple options. This solution will depend on JavaScript progressive enhancement. Existing off-the-shelf solutions \u00b6 Single select only from GDS/Alphagov \u00b6 There is an Accessible Autocomplete component ( Github and examples ) maintained by GDS that is very useful for single select.

Multi-select accessibility focussed, but not maintained \u00b6 Github user mynamesleaon has built upon the Accessible Autocomplete module making his own called Aria Autocomplete , which includes multiple file selection. Similarly to Accessible Autocomplete it can progressively enhance already rendered HTML checkboxes or selects. It has an accessibility focus (\u201cUse of ARIA attributes, custom screen reader announcements, and testing with assistive technologies\u201d) but isn\u2019t being maintained activley compared to the GDS/alphagov predecessor.

Deque University - Tree View example Tree view is a hierarchical structure with parent and child nodes that can expand and collapse.

The impacts of current human activities will continue over long periods,\u201d they summarized (17). Seen from this perspective, the Anthropocene is a sci-fi trope that calls on us to see the Earth as an alien planet\u2014terraformed by beginners who did not quite know what they were doing but who might be trained to do better in the future. Terraforming is political \u00b6 2312 shows how humans have created/designed with their landscape (e.g. Mercury) incorporating continuous change/movement. They later return to Earth and find that all land is contested. Is Ursula Heise suggesting that we need a reality check in light of unstoppable, increasing urbanisation to the point that we reconsider our role in relation to designing urban green space. That we can consider more utopian idea (e.g. 2312) about human intervention in a positive way? terraforming decisions that are easy in environments not naturally hospitable to human life turn out to be very difficult on Earth, where every acre of land is contested territory in terms of ownership rights, historical memories, cultural traditions, and current uses. Contested spaces. Novel ecosystems \u00b6 With increasing urbanisation conservationists, amongst others, pay more attention to urban green spaces \u201cgray spaces,\u201d large numbers of empty lots that often spontaneously turn into habitat for plants and animals. Gray spaces are similar to ruderals or probably contain them. Beyond that, urban ecosystems are also known to have ecological properties of their own: they generate their own temperature environments and sustain particular mixes of native and nonnative biodiversity. The notion of \u201cnovel ecosystems\u201d proposed by Australian ecologist Richard J.
