Folder items can be expanded to reveal the contents of the folder \u2014 which may be files, folders, or both \u2014 and collapsed, hiding its contents. Deque University - Tree View example Tree view is a hierarchical structure with parent and child nodes that can expand and collapse. Tree views on the web are not common, but they do exist, often to represent a file system or other similar structure of folders and files.
