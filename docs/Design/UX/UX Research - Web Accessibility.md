# ARIA

Don’t Use ARIA Menu Roles for Site Nav
https://adrianroselli.com/2017/10/dont-use-aria-menu-roles-for-site-nav.html

And generally don't use it when not necessary. 


### Menus vs Nav

Menus in ARIA are used to replicate native desktop behaviour
https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_menus

Navs are for site wide content, not single page.
