Exploring options for documenting designs and tracking design changes. 

**Notes:**
- Currently we are missing error state content in a lot of places
- Differences between user flows and screen flows

---

A lot of this is lifted from the [excellent article by Stefanie Walter](https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/a-designers-guide-to-documenting-accessibility-user-interactions/). 

## Component level documentation (GDS)

Thankfully the [Gov Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) takes care of the component level documentation unless we are creating our own components, for example the tree view. It should cover:
- State changes
- User interactions
- Accessibility
- ~~Detailed design spec~ ~ 
	- This should be readable from design files or coded prototype

## Examples 

### Components details

Including interactions & keyboard nav
