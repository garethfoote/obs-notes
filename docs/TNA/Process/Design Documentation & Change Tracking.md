Exploring options for documenting designs and tracking design changes. 

**Notes:**
- Currently we are missing error state content in a lot of places
- Differences between user flows and screen flows

---

A lot of this is lifted from the [excellent article by Stefanie Walter](https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/a-designers-guide-to-documenting-accessibility-user-interactions/). 

# Accessiblity Documentation
What design, content or interaction elements are at risk of being lost or forgotten between ux, design and dev.

- HTML title of the page
- Landmarks
	- Example from [Figma Plugin for accessibility annotations](https://www.figma.com/community/file/984136149483735147)
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-10-10 at 12.12.16.png]]- HTML headings in the page
- Focus order at page level

# General Documentation
## Component level documentation (GDS)

Thankfully the [Gov Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) takes care of the component level documentation unless we are creating our own components, for example the tree view. It should cover:
- State changes
- User interactions
- Accessibility
- ~~Detailed design spec~ ~ 
	- This should be readable from design files or coded prototype

> [!INFO]
> See [[#Examples]] for how a dropdown component could be documented.


## User flows and screen flows

> **User flows** (on the left) are kind of “step by step” boxes and arrow graphs that document how someone accomplishes a task. They list **pages**, views, branchings, … They are usually built at the beginning of the project to help plan those pages and flows.

> **Screen flows** (on the right) are kind of the same. But instead of boxes for pages, I put the real interface mockups. I build those at the end, once we went through usability testing, refinement and have mockups. Both help the dev team understand how the user will navigate across the whole interface.

![User vs Screen flows](https://stephaniewalter.design/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/20-userflow-2.jpg)

We have been discussing creating 'Screen flows' in order to help the dev team (and other team members) understand the flow between pages. Having a macro level mapping of this is also useful to have visibilty across pages for consistency.  

# Examples 

## Components details

This example includes interactions & keyboard navigation.
