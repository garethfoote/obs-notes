Currently working on how to effectively [[Design Documentation & Change Tracking|document and track designs]] through our process. 

Creating [[Prototypes|3 variations on our coded prototype]] to accomodate different stages of the design process. 

Jira process from UX research into Design into Dev implmentation tbc. However PO has suggested that it is the responsibility of the designer to create an implementation card from a design card if it doesn't already exist.
